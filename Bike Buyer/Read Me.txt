Bike Buyer Project

Project Details**

In this project I have performed data cleaning, transformation using power query and I developed pivot table that lead to create different visualization. 

I developed the interactive dashboard for Bike Buyer Project using pivot chart in Microsoft Excel answering questions such as
     i.	What is the purchase decision per person based on region? 
     ii.What is the average income per gender based on purchase decision?
     iii.What is the purchase decision per person based on education?
     iv.What is the purchase decision per person based on commute distance?

Also, I have also created or added different slicers for easy access inspection and visualization of dashboard.
